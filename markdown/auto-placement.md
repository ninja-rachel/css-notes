The default behavior of grid layout is to place items along the rows. You can instead cause the items to place into columns usingÂ **`grid-auto-flow: column`**. 

You need to define row tracks otherwise the ==items will create intrinsic column tracks, and layout out all in one long row.

These values relate to the writing mode of the document. 

A row always runs in the direction a sentence runs in the writing mode of the document or component.
