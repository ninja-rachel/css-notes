## Literals and properties

We can immediately put some properties into `{...}` as “key: value” pairs:

```javascript

let user = {     // an object   
	name: "John",  // by key "name" store value 
	"John"   age: 30        // by key "age" store value 30 };`
```

A property has a key (also known as “name” or “identifier”) before the colon `":"` and a value to the right of it.

In the `user` object, there are two properties:

1.  The first property has the name `"name"` and the value `"John"`.
2.  The second one has the name `"age"` and the value `30`.

The resulting `user` object can be imagined as a cabinet with two signed files labeled “name” and “age”.
